To set up the GT03B for your server:

SERVER 0,<ip>,<port>,0#		// Configure server.
TIMER 60,5#			// 60 s between LBS packages, 5 s between GPS packages
GMT E,1#			// Configure time-zone (in this case to CET).

This software is made to run on OS X. Be sure to open up your firewall to whatever port is used.
The application is a work-in-progress and proof-of-concept. Obviously, one would need to serve
the collected data in some way for it to be useful.

Right now everything works fine, except that the unit stops sending GPS data after 60 s. I've
managed to get it to start again by sending GPSON#, but
* it doesn't work most of the time
* when it does work, the unit stops sending data after a short while.

My entire setup is also suffering from irritating non-reproducibility. If you have any luck,
please let me know!
